# Brand_Perception_Project
This is a project from Python Playground Workshop.

This project analyzes sentiment from Dataset_1.csv using the VADER sentiment analysis tool. The results are visualized using Matplotlib to provide insights into the sentiment distribution related to a specific brand or topic.

The project was to make a Brand Perception Monitor that tracks sentiment around a brand. 

As for the datasest I have used the reviews/perception of TikTok by many individuals.
(I have only used the dataset for research purpose.)

For this project I have Used -->

--> Vader -- For Sentiment Analysis.

--> Pandas -- For working with the Dataset.

--> Matplotlib -- For visualization and graph.

You Can Install all these libraries by using pip from "pypi.org". 

For vaderSentiment simply just clone the repository of vaderSentiment in the desired folder.

Thank you for reading....
